=head1 NAME

Test::Server::MPD - Create MPD test servers at whim

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Server::MPD;

    my $server = Test::Server::MPD->new(
      port => '12345', # defaults to 6600 or an empty port
      profiles => {
        'letmein' => [qw( read control )],
      },
    );
    $server->start;

    ...

    # You might want to put this in and END block, or
    # guard it with Scope::Guard, in case your test dies
    $server->stop;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module makes it easy to start and stop MPD server instances for testing.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item C<config>

The path to a configfile for the server. If this attribute is set, then that
file will be used to start the server. If not provided, then the file provided
as the C<template> attribute will be populated with the rest of the object's
attributes.

=item C<template>

The path to a config template file. Defaults to a file shipped with this
distribution. The template uses a very limited version of the mustache
templating system. It recognises the following keys: C<port>, C<root>, C<host>.

The special key C<profiles> populates the C<password> attributes of the MPD
config files. If no C<profiles> are provided, this key will instead populate
the C<default_permissions> value with all permissions.

=item C<port>

The port on which the server will be listening. Defaults to the value of the
C<MPD_PORT> environment variable, or 6600 if undefined. If 6600 is already in
use (likely by another MPD server), an empty port will be found using
L<Net::EmptyPort>.

Note that it is possible (however unlikely) that the port that was found to
be empty is actually not by the time the server starts.

=item C<host>

The host to use for the server. Defaults to C<localhost>.

=item C<profiles>

A hash reference with as many keys as profiles to use. Keys are the passwords,
and the values (which should be array references) indicate the permissions
for that profile.

=item C<bin>

The path to the MPD binary. Defaults to the one found by L<File::Which>. This
value is not checked until the server is C<start>ed (or C<stop>ped).

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<start>

Start the MPD server using the object's C<config> file, or one created by the
object's C<template>. Returns the C<pid> of the server process.

This method will throw an exception if the C<bin> attribute is not set to a
plain file, or if there was an error starting the server.

=item C<stop>

Stop the MPD server.

This method will throw an exception if the C<bin> attribute is not set to a
plain file, or if there was an error stopping the server.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item L<Test::Corpus::Audio::MPD>

The inspiration for this module, used by L<POE::Component::Client::MPD> and
L<Audio::MPD>. The fact that it cannot be made to coexist with a running
instance of MPD, and that it starts its server automatically upon use,
partly explain the existance of this module.
